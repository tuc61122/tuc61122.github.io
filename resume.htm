<h2>SUMMARY </h2>
</br>
Organic Chemist with more than ten years of experience in synthesis of compounds for medicinal use and design of synthesis routes to increase efficiency and decrease cost.  Throughout my career I have demonstrated creative synthesis, trouble shooting and strong analytical skills.  Designed novel scaffolds with biological potency on bacteria. Achieved experimental proficiency with organometallic synthesis techniques for moisture and air sensitive chemistry. Streamlined purification to allow key test of a compound on interest by using crystallization instead of multiple chromatographies. Successfully achieved and made practical multikilogram synthesis that was green, more efficient and cost effective.
